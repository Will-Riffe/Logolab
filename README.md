# Logolab

  ## Description
  Logos give credit to the maker; they are what allow others to recognize our work. This repository contains a basic-shape logo generator,  allowing users to create a quick logo without extensive steps or consideration needed. This command-line node application prompts and accepts user input for text, text color, logo shapes, and shape color. Users can enter up to three characters for their text, then choose from a list of shapes, including: circles, triangles, and squares. Both color keyword, and hexadecimal numbers, are accepted for input.
